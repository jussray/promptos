# promptos-operator

## Trigger

Use for every nontrivial task, repository-state claim, code or documentation change, deployment discussion, review, or recovery operation in `jussray/promptos`.

## 5W1H operating contract

Before planning, editing, or claiming completion, establish and state:

- **Who** — the requester, decision owner, affected users, data subjects, and execution authority.
- **What** — the requested outcome, concrete deliverable, non-goals, and existing work that must be preserved.
- **Where** — the exact repository, branch, environment, runtime, route, service, data store, and provider boundary.
- **When** — the current lifecycle or release state, required ordering, timing constraint, and rollback window.
- **Why** — the user problem and verified evidence that justify the work.
- **How** — the smallest safe implementation, required permissions, verification evidence, rollout, and rollback.

Inspect repository and runtime truth for unknowns. Ask only when a missing answer materially changes the safe solution or authority. Re-run 5W1H after red-team/OODA findings change the plan. Finish by mapping the result, evidence, remaining blocker, and next owner back to all six questions.

## Repository identity

**Repository:** `jussray/promptos`

**Role:** A prompt library for OODA, red-team, L99, Lindy, coding, and founder operations.

This is a reviewed orientation, not permanent truth. Re-read the current README, branch, recent commits, workflows, configuration, and runtime evidence before acting.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- Treat prompts as versioned instructions, not proof that a capability or tool is implemented.
- Keep provider-specific adapters separate from provider-neutral prompt intent.
- Never embed secrets, private user content, minor data, or unredacted company data in reusable prompts.
- Preserve prompt identifiers and document migrations when changing semantics.
- Test counts, links, routing, and examples against repository truth before claiming library completeness.

## Required loop

1. Observe the exact branch, changed files, existing implementation, data boundaries, and available evidence.
2. Complete 5W1H and identify any authority or safety gap.
3. Red-team the premise, privacy, security, misuse, failure modes, and rollback.
4. Choose the smallest reversible action that preserves existing work.
5. Implement only within the confirmed repository role.
6. Run proportionate checks on the exact head.
7. Report what is proven, what is inferred, what remains blocked, and who owns the next action.

## Verification

- `Inspect repository-provided validation scripts and run every applicable prompt-library check.`

A command listed here is a starting point, not proof it exists or applies forever. Discover current scripts and workflows first. A skipped, stale, unstarted, or older-SHA check is not a pass.

## Output

Return:

- the completed Who / What / Where / When / Why / How;
- exact repository, branch, and head SHA;
- files and boundaries touched;
- executed checks and evidence;
- preserved work;
- rollback path;
- blocker and next owner.

Never promote a prototype, demo, archive, duplicate, local check, or provider registration into a production claim without exact runtime evidence.
